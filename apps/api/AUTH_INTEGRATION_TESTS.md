# Auth Integration Tests Summary

## Overview
The auth integration tests have been successfully implemented and all 28 tests are passing. The tests provide comprehensive coverage for the authentication module, following clean architecture principles and ensuring proper test isolation.

## Test Coverage

### Registration
- ✅ Register a new user successfully
- ✅ Fail registration with invalid email
- ✅ Fail registration with weak password
- ✅ Fail registration with missing required fields
- ✅ Fail registration with existing email

### Login
- ✅ Login successfully with valid credentials
- ✅ Fail login with invalid email
- ✅ Fail login with invalid password
- ✅ Fail login with missing credentials

### Token Refresh
- ✅ Refresh token successfully
- ✅ Fail refresh with invalid token
- ✅ Fail refresh with missing token

### Logout
- ✅ Logout successfully with valid token
- ✅ Fail logout without authentication
- ✅ Fail logout with invalid access token

### Password Reset
- ✅ Initiate password reset successfully
- ✅ Handle password reset for non-existent email gracefully
- ✅ Fail password reset with invalid email format
- ✅ Reset password successfully with valid token
- ✅ Fail password reset with invalid token
- ✅ Fail password reset with weak password

### Email Verification
- ✅ Verify email successfully with valid token
- ✅ Fail email verification with invalid token
- ✅ Fail email verification with missing token

### Authentication Guards
- ✅ Protect routes with JWT guard
- ✅ Allow access with valid JWT token

### Session Management
- ✅ Create session on login
- ✅ Invalidate session on logout

## Clean Architecture Compliance
- All database access is handled via repository classes in `repositories/`
- Business logic is encapsulated in services
- Controllers only handle routing and validation
- DTOs are used for input validation and transformation
- Entities and interfaces are defined in `entities/`
- Constants and enums are placed in `constants/`

## Test Isolation
- Each test uses unique data and cleans up after itself
- Mail service is mocked to avoid external dependencies
- Tests are CI-friendly and do not require real email sending

## Status
**All 28 auth integration tests are passing. The authentication module is robust, well-tested, and follows clean architecture best practices.**
